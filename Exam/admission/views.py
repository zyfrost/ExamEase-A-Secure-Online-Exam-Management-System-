# achieve this:

# Update the View to Admit Successful Candidates and Generate Matriculation Numbers:

# Identify successful candidates based on meeting the cut-off scores.
# Generate unique matriculation numbers for admitted candidates.
# Implement Data Transfer to Respective Departments and Programs:

# Define a mechanism to post the details of admitted candidates to the respective
# departments and programs.
